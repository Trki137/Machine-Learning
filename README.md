# Machine Learning - FER

This repository contains lab exercises from the **Machine Learning** course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER). These labs cover fundamental machine learning techniques and models, implemented and tested on various datasets.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **Linear Regression**  
    This lab focuses on implementing and analyzing linear regression models. The key topics include ordinary least squares, gradient descent, and regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso.

2. **Linear Discriminative Models and Logistic Regression**  
    In this lab, we explore linear discriminative models, with a particular focus on logistic regression. Topics include binary and multiclass classification, decision boundaries, and model evaluation metrics.

3. **Support Vector Machines and Non-Parametric Methods**  
    This lab covers Support Vector Machines (SVM) and non-parametric methods such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). We implement and compare these models, discussing their strengths and limitations for different types of data.

4. **Parameter Estimation, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Clustering**  
    The final lab delves into parameter estimation techniques, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian estimation. Additionally, we work with probabilistic graphical models and explore clustering algorithms like k-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
